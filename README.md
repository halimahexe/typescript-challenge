# TypeScript challenge

Practice using various TypeScript features to write more robust code.

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v20) installed.

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/typescript-challenge/generate), clone your copy, cd into it
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
1. Run `npm run build` to run the TS compiler and check for errors

## Challenge 1

Open `src/1.ts` in your editor. Add type annotations to the functions so that there are no longer any type errors.

## Challenge 2

Open `src/2.ts` in your editor. There are several types defined for various shapes. Complete the `area` function so that it correctly returns the area for each different shape.

## Challenge 3

Open `src/3.ts` in your editor. You should see a comment with some example Pokémon data. Complete the `findByType` function. It should receive two parameters: an array of Pokémon objects like the example, and a type to filter for. It should return any Pokémon with a matching type.
